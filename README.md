# WhiteBoard_using_OpenCV

I'm excited to share my latest project, a whiteboard system that leverages computer vision to enable seamless collaboration. Using a combination of hand tracking and gesture recognition, users can join their thumb and index finger to write on the screen, and join their index and middle fingers to erase. This innovative solution eliminates the need for traditional input devices, allowing users to focus on the creative process. With its intuitive interface and real-time feedback, this project has the potential to transform the way we work together.
